A Flutter project.

## Overview
This Flutter project demonstrates the implementation of the repository pattern architecture along with additional features like Bloc with Cubit, GetX for routing, Intl for localizations, and ScreenUtils for sizing. The repository pattern is a design pattern that isolates the logic that retrieves data and maps it to the entity model from the business logic.

## Dependencies
Bloc: A predictable state management library.
GetX: A lightweight and powerful state management solution with routing.
Intl: Internationalization and localization support.
screen_utils: A utility for sizing and responsive design.
